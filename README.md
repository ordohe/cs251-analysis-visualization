# CS251: Data Analysis & Visualization

This repository contains projects completed as part of Colby College’s CS251 course. The course emphasized practical data science techniques including exploratory data analysis, regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction using Python.

## 📁 Projects

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
Cleaned and explored a real-world dataset using Pandas and Seaborn to uncover patterns and relationships.

### 📈 Linear Regression
Implemented linear regression models from scratch and with `scikit-learn`, evaluating model performance and generalization.

### 🧠 Neural Networks
Built and trained a feedforward neural network using NumPy. Explored how architecture and learning rates affect accuracy.

### ✉️ Spam Classification
Used Naive Bayes and KNN algorithms to classify emails as spam or ham. Trained on the Enron dataset and evaluated accuracy.

### 📊 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Reduced dataset dimensionality using PCA and visualized component projections to reveal underlying structure.

### 🧬 Clustering
Applied k-means clustering to segment data and evaluated cluster cohesion. Used clustering for basic image compression and pattern discovery.
